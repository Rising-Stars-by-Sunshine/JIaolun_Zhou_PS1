# Self introduction
My name is Jiaolun Zhou and I am studying computer science at Duke Kunshan University. I conducted research in the sensing and interaction laboratory, and had certain research on the Internet of Things and game programming (unity2D, rpgmaker). Currently, two self-developed horizontal board pixel games have been released on github.
# Brief Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub page dedicated to the exciting world of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), where we unravel the intricacies of using XAI to explain real-world phenomena. Within this repository, I delve into the fascinating realm of model interpretability and decision transparency using the powerful Sensitivity Analysis Library, SALib.

In today's data-driven landscape, understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is paramount. SALib serves as our trusty companion, enabling us to dissect the influence of input parameters on model outputs, bringing clarity to complex AI-based decision-making processes.

Explore this repository to embark on a journey of model transparency and interpretability. Whether you're a novice intrigued by XAI or a seasoned practitioner seeking advanced insights, you'll discover a treasure trove of resources, code examples, and explanations to harness SALib effectively for a variety of real-world scenarios. Gain the skills to decode your models and make data-driven decisions that matter. Start your XAI adventure with SALib today!
