## Description 
- This dataset contains eleven main factors of a car from both China and oversea markets. Data comes from two professional car website and are collected manually by the author. These data are used for testing and training the model so that the readers can see the effect of the model. If in the future, this research needs more data, future researchers can visit these two websites and get the data. The websites are in the reference list.
