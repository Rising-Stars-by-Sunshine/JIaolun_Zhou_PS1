# Definition of XAI
XAI stands for "Explainable Artificial Intelligence." It refers to the practice of developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and machine learning models in such a way that their outputs and decision-making processes can be easily understood and explained by humans. The goal of XAI is to make AI more transparent and interpretable, addressing the "black box" problem where AI models make complex decisions that are difficult to comprehend.

In the context of XAI, "explainability" means providing insights into why an AI system arrived at a particular decision or prediction. This can be crucial in applications where transparency and accountability are important, such as healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and legal systems. By making AI systems more explainable, developers and users can gain a better understanding of their behavior and potential biases, ultimately enhancing trust and enabling better decision-making.

Various techniques and approaches are used in XAI, including the development of interpretable models, the generation of model-agnostic explanations, and the visualization of decision processes. The specific methods employed may vary depending on the AI application and the level of interpretability required.

# Literature
# Introduction:
Binder et al.(2020) focused on the language model. The focus of this paper lies in language models, particularly BERT, which are extensively utilized in text analytics tasks such as sentiment analysis. These models, however, pose a challenge as they are often perceived as opaque "black boxes," making their predictions difficult to comprehend. There is an emerging need for explainable AI (XAI) to deconstruct and rationalize predictions made by complex AI models, like BERT, to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR's "right to explanation."

# Motivation:
Existing XAI methods for language models primarily concentrate on local, instance-specific reconstructions and lack strategies for achieving a global understanding of the model. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by introducing a novel global XAI approach that leverages linguistic rules to reconstruct BERT's predictions.

# Research Questions:
RQ1: How can language model predictions be globally reconstructed using linguistic rules?

RQ2: How can the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility of global reconstructions be analyzed?

# Methods:
The authors of the paper extract linguistic rules that are constructed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) building blocks such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and dependencies to reconstruct BERT's predictions. Fidelity and comprehensibility are evaluated using metrics like F1 score and the number of rules. Experiments are conducted, focusing on aspect and sentiment detection within online reviews.

# Results:
The paper demonstrates that linguistic rules can successfully reconstruct BERT's predictions, achieving fidelity rates in the range of 78-82%. Depending on the specific objective, rule sets can be designed to emphasize either comprehensibility or fidelity. This illustrates that linguistic rules offer the potential for both high-fidelity and interpretable global reconstructions of language models. The paper also highlights the capability to balance the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility according to the requirements of a particular application.

# Relation to XAI:
This paper introduces an innovative global, model-agnostic XAI approach tailored for complex neural language models like BERT. It illustrates how linguistic rules can provide interpretable global reconstructions, effectively opening the "black box," in alignment with the core goals of XAI. The analysis of the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility offers valuable insights for the design of XAI systems, enabling a balance that suits specific use cases.

Overall, this work significantly advances the XAI capabilities within a critical category of AI systems, namely neural language models.

# Theoretical aspect
The theoretical aspect of XAI involves developing models and frameworks that aim to elucidate the decision-making processes of complex AI algorithms. These theories often focus on creating more interpretable representations and algorithms, bridging the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and human understanding.

# Empirical observation
Empirical observation in XAI encompasses the practical application of these theories in real-world scenarios. It involves collecting data on how users interact with AI systems and the challenges they face in understanding the AI's decisions. This empirical research helps identify the limitations and areas for improvement in explainability, refining theoretical models based on real-world use cases.

# Experimental investigation
Experimental investigation in XAI involves conducting controlled experiments to assess the effectiveness of different explainability techniques. Researchers may compare the interpretability of AI systems with and without XAI methods, measuring factors like user comprehension, trust, and decision accuracy. Through these experiments, the field aims to empirically validate and refine the theoretical models and inform the development of best practices for creating more transparent AI systems. Overall, XAI integrates these three aspects to foster a deeper understanding of AI models and improve their usability in various domains while addressing the "black box" problem.
