# Definition of XAI
XAI stands for "Explainable Artificial Intelligence." It refers to the practice of developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and machine learning models in such a way that their outputs and decision-making processes can be easily understood and explained by humans. The goal of XAI is to make AI more transparent and interpretable, addressing the "black box" problem where AI models make complex decisions that are difficult to comprehend.

In the context of XAI, "explainability" means providing insights into why an AI system arrived at a particular decision or prediction. This can be crucial in applications where transparency and accountability are important, such as healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and legal systems. By making AI systems more explainable, developers and users can gain a better understanding of their behavior and potential biases, ultimately enhancing trust and enabling better decision-making.

Various techniques and approaches are used in XAI, including the development of interpretable models, the generation of model-agnostic explanations, and the visualization of decision processes. The specific methods employed may vary depending on the AI application and the level of interpretability required.

# Literature
# Introduction:
Binder et al.(2020) focused on the language model. The focus of this paper lies in language models, particularly BERT, which are extensively utilized in text analytics tasks such as sentiment analysis. These models, however, pose a challenge as they are often perceived as opaque "black boxes," making their predictions difficult to comprehend. There is an emerging need for explainable AI (XAI) to deconstruct and rationalize predictions made by complex AI models, like BERT, to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR's "right to explanation."

# Motivation:
Existing XAI methods for language models primarily concentrate on local, instance-specific reconstructions and lack strategies for achieving a global understanding of the model. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by introducing a novel global XAI approach that leverages linguistic rules to reconstruct BERT's predictions.

# Research Questions:
RQ1: How can language model predictions be globally reconstructed using linguistic rules?

RQ2: How can the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility of global reconstructions be analyzed?

# Methods:
The authors of the paper extract linguistic rules that are constructed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) building blocks such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and dependencies to reconstruct BERT's predictions. Fidelity and comprehensibility are evaluated using metrics like F1 score and the number of rules. Experiments are conducted, focusing on aspect and sentiment detection within online reviews.

# Results:
The paper demonstrates that linguistic rules can successfully reconstruct BERT's predictions, achieving fidelity rates in the range of 78-82%. Depending on the specific objective, rule sets can be designed to emphasize either comprehensibility or fidelity. This illustrates that linguistic rules offer the potential for both high-fidelity and interpretable global reconstructions of language models. The paper also highlights the capability to balance the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility according to the requirements of a particular application.

# Relation to XAI:
This paper introduces an innovative global, model-agnostic XAI approach tailored for complex neural language models like BERT. It illustrates how linguistic rules can provide interpretable global reconstructions, effectively opening the "black box," in alignment with the core goals of XAI. The analysis of the trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility offers valuable insights for the design of XAI systems, enabling a balance that suits specific use cases.

Overall, this work significantly advances the XAI capabilities within a critical category of AI systems, namely neural language models.

# Theoretical aspect
The theoretical aspect of my upcoming work involves developing models , using others' XAI structures and frameworks that aim to elucidate the decision-making processes of complex AI algorithms. These theories often focus on creating more interpretable representations and algorithms, bridging the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and human understanding.

# Empirical observation
Empirical observation in my upcoming work encompasses the practical application of these theories in real-world scenarios. It involves collecting data on how users interact with AI systems and the challenges they face in understanding the AI's decisions. This empirical research helps identify the limitations and areas for improvement in explainability, refining theoretical models based on real-world use cases.

# Experimental investigation
Experimental investigation in my upcoming work involves conducting controlled experiments to assess the effectiveness of different explainability techniques. Researchers may compare the interpretability of AI systems with and without XAI methods, measuring factors like user comprehension, trust, and decision accuracy. Through these experiments, the field aims to empirically validate and refine the theoretical models and inform the development of best practices for creating more transparent AI systems. Overall, XAI integrates these three aspects to foster a deeper understanding of AI models and improve their usability in various domains while addressing the "black box" problem.

# My research
Name of the research: Interpretable Machine Learning for Autonomous Vehicles: Bridging the Gap with explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
# Background/Motivation:

Autonomous driving technology is advancing rapidly, but the use of black-box machine learning models in autonomous vehicles has raised concerns regarding their interpretability and trustworthiness. Uninterpretable models can limit the widespread adoption of autonomous driving, particularly in high-risk domains such as urban traffic or medical emergencies (Rudin, 2019).

# Research Question:

This study aims to explore how explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance the interpretability of autonomous driving systems, thereby explaining the decisions of black-box models and providing greater transparency (Lundberg & Lee, 2017).

# Application Scenarios:

We will focus on autonomous vehicles as our case study, encompassing scenarios in city traffic, highways, autonomous taxis, and medical emergency response vehicles. These scenarios require vehicles to make decisions such as obstacle avoidance, compliance with traffic rules, and adapting to different weather conditions (Rudin, 2019).

# Methodology:

The research will employ the unified approach proposed by Lundberg and Lee (2017) for explaining machine learning model predictions and incorporate the local interpretability method suggested by Chen et al. (2018). These methods will be applied to autonomous driving models to generate interpretable decision processes.

# Results:

The study aims to demonstrate how XAI methods can enhance the interpretability of models in the field of autonomous vehicles, providing clearer explanations of model decisions, and thereby increasing trust and transparency in the autonomous driving system (Binder et al., 2018).

# Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts:

By successfully applying XAI methods, the research intends to provide interpretable models for the field of autonomous vehicles, contributing to increased trust, reduced risks, and enhanced safety and transparency in practical applications. This could advance the development and widespread use of autonomous driving technology (Caruana et al., 2018).
